Sharia Marriage Manual:
Crush her spirit
Break her soul
Teach this woman her new role
Curb her speech
Teach her her worth
Cooking cleaning birth and birth
Birth and birth and birth and birth
Cooking cleaning birth and birth
Claim her children 
Quote 4:34
Keep her gaze upon the floor
Keep her fearing 
of Talaq
This is how you make your mark
Keep her locked
Within your home
And all your antics are unknown
If she cries
Call her a whore
Sow your oats then get three more
~ Gulaabi Niqaabi
